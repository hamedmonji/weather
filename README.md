# weather

## test weather projects

## what's used

i've used mvvm architecture with kotlin flow and coroutines and koin for dependency injection

i tried to make this assignment in a way that would show my skills but without going fully deep into building a application, 
for instance you'll only see one model rather than having different models for different layers along with mappers.

## testing

please note i've only written few limited tests, but enough to do demonstrate that things are testable and also how i would approach testing.

## dependencies
dependencies include coroutines,retforit,koin,navigation and standard viewmodel and lifecycle dependencies, nothing suprising!.
